      <t>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broad field dedicated to creating
   systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human
   intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding
   language.  Within AI, Machine Learning (ML) is a subset that focuses
   on developing algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make
   decisions based on data, improving their performance over time
   without explicit programming.  Deep Learning is a further subset of
   ML that utilizes neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to
   analyze various factors of data.  This approach is particularly
   powerful in handling large and complex datasets, making significant
   advancements in areas such as image and speech recognition, natural
   language processing, and autonomous systems.</t>
      <t>Generative AI (Gen-AI) is a specialized branch of ML that involves
   training models to generate new content, such as text, images, or
   music, by learning patterns from existing data, thereby enhancing the
   creative and adaptive capabilities of AI systems.  Deep Learning
   techniques are often employed in Gen-AI to create more sophisticated
   and realistic outputs, pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve

        <t>AI-powered operator assistants function as virtual network engineers,
   providing real-time recommendations, insights, and automated
   solutions.  These advanced systems leverage the power of natural
   language processing (NLP) to facilitate seamless and intuitive
   interactions between operators and the network management interface.
   By understanding and interpreting human language, these AI assistants
   can effectively communicate with operators, making it easier for them
   to manage complex network environments without needing extensive
   technical expertise.</t>
        <t>In addition to NLP, Operator Assistance can integrate other AINetOps
   functions to solve operators scenarios and use-cases.  This
   capability allows the system to provide timely alerts and
   recommendations, helping operators to address issues before they

      <section anchor="network-active-and-reactive-assurance">
        <name>Network active and reactive assurance</name>
        <t>Network active and reactive assurance and troubleshooting, both at the single-
   layer (IP or Optical) and multi-layer (IP over Optical), are critical
   components in maintaining the health and stability of modern IP,
   Optical, and IPoDWDM networks.  This process involves the
   identification and resolution of network issues as they arise,
   ensuring that any disruptions or degradations are promptly addressed.
   By employing AINetOps techniques, network engineers can quickly
   pinpoint the root cause of problems, whether they originate in the IP
   layer, the optical layer, or across both.  This reactive approach is
   essential for minimizing downtime and maintaining the quality of
   service expected by network users.</t>
        <t>In single-layer troubleshooting, the focus is on isolating and
   resolving issues within a specific layer of the network.  For
   example, in an IP network, this might involve diagnosing routing
   problems, addressing IP address conflicts, IP layer misconfiguration,
   hardware failure or resolving issues with network protocols.  In an
   optical network, single-layer troubleshooting could involve
   identifying fiber cuts, optical signal degradation, or equipment
   failures</t>
        <t>Multi-layer troubleshooting, on the other hand, requires a more
   integrated approach, as it involves identifying and resolving issues
   that span across multiple layers of the network.  This could include
   problems where an issue in the optical layer affects the IP layer,
   such as signal impairments that impact data transmission quality.  By
   effectively managing both single-layer and multi-layer
   troubleshooting, network engineers can ensure a more robust and
   resilient network infrastructure.</t>
        <t>The importance of assurance and troubleshooting cannot be
   overstated in today's high-demand network environments.  Rapid
   response to network issues is crucial to maintaining service
   continuity and meeting the expectations of end-users.  Advanced
   diagnostic tools and techniques, such as real-time monitoring,
   automated alerts, and detailed analytics, play a vital role in this
   process.  These tools enable engineers to quickly detect anomalies,
   assess their impact, and implement corrective actions.  Through
   continuous improvement of assurance and troubleshooting
   practices, network operators can enhance their ability to maintain
   network performance, reduce operational risks, and deliver a reliable
   and high-quality service to their customers.</t>
        <section anchor="root-cause-analysis">
          <name>Root Cause Analysis</name>
          <t>In the context of "Network active and reactive assurance," Root Cause Analysis
   (RCA) is a critical aspect that extends the reactive troubleshooting
   process to uncover the underlying reasons behind network issues.
   When an issue is detected in the network, RCA leverages advanced
   AINetOps techniques to correlate events across different layers of
   the network, whether it be IP, Optical, or a combination of both.
   This comprehensive approach ensures that the root cause of an issue
   is accurately identified, rather than just addressing the symptoms.
   Techniques such as graph-based analysis enable network engineers to
   visualize and trace the sequence of events leading to a problem,
   providing a clear pathway to the source of the issue.</t>
          <t>Moreover, natural language processing (NLP) for log analysis plays a
   significant role in RCA by automating the examination of vast amounts
   of log data generated by network devices.  NLP can sift through logs
   to identify patterns and anomalies that might be missed by manual
   inspection.  This capability is particularly useful in multi-layer
   networks where issues in one layer can propagate and manifest in
   another.  By efficiently parsing through logs and correlating data,
   NLP helps pinpoint the exact cause of disruptions, thereby reducing
   the mean time to resolution (MTTR).  Additionally, knowledge graph
   representations provide a structured and interconnected view of
   network components and their relationships, aiding in the rapid
   identification of fault points and their impact on the network.</t>
          <t>By accurately diagnosing the root cause of network issues, network
   operators can implement targeted corrective actions that address the
   core problem, preventing recurrence and ensuring long-term stability.
   This precision in troubleshooting not only minimizes downtime but
   also enhances the overall reliability and performance of the network.
   Furthermore, insights gained from RCA can inform proactive measures
   and optimization strategies, contributing to a more resilient network
   infrastructure.  In essence, RCA empowers network engineers with the
   tools and knowledge needed to maintain high service quality and meet
   the demands of modern, high-performance networks.</t>

        <name>Predictive Analytics</name>
        <t>Predictive analytics or advanced analytics uses historical and real-
   time network data, statistical algorithms, and ML techniques to
   identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on past data.  In
   the context of network operations, predictive analytics involves the
   use of these methodologies in following areas to anticipate network
   issues, optimize performance, and improve operational efficiency.  By
   examining patterns and trends in historical network data, predictive
   analytics can potentially forecast network problems before they
   occur, allowing for proactive management and maintenance.</t>
        <t>The core idea behind predictive analytics is to transform data into
   actionable insights.  For network operations, this means analyzing
   various metrics such as traffic patterns, latency, performance
   management (PM) data, and equipment performance to predict future
   states of the network.  For instance, by identifying trends that have
   historically led to network failures, predictive analytics can alert
   operators to potential future failures, enabling them to take
   preventive measures.  This proactive approach helps in minimizing
   downtime, enhancing service reliability, and optimizing resource
   allocation.</t>
        <t>In summary, predictive analytics in network operations is about
   leveraging historical data and advanced analytical techniques to
   foresee and address potential issues before they impact the network.
   This approach leads to more efficient, reliable, and secure network
   operations, ultimately enhancing the overall performance and user
   experience.  The AINetOps can address the following operator's
   scenarios.</t>
        <section anchor="proactive-network-assurance-and-monitoring-health-check">
          <name>Proactive Network Assurance and Monitoring (Health Check)</name>
          <t>Proactive Network Assurance and Monitoring represents a paradigm
   shift from the Network active and reactive assurance discussed in Section 5.2.
   Instead of waiting for issues to arise and then addressing them,
   proactive network assurance involves anticipating potential problems
   and implementing measures to prevent them from occurring.  This
   forward-thinking strategy leverages AINetOps to predict and mitigate
   network issues before they impact service quality.</t>
          <t>In single-layer proactive assurance, the focus is on continuously
   monitoring and analyzing the health of a specific layer IP or Optical
   layer of the network to identify early warning signs of potential
   issues.  For instance, in an IP network, this might involve analyzing
   traffic patterns to detect anomalies that could indicate an impending
   routing problem or hardware failure.  ML algorithms can be employed
   to predict IP address conflicts or protocol misconfigurations before
   they cause disruptions.  Similarly, in an optical network, proactive
   assurance could involve monitoring signal quality and fiber integrity
   to detect and address degradations before they lead to significant
   impairments or outages.</t>
          <t>Multi-layer proactive assurance takes this approach a step further by
   integrating monitoring and analysis across both the IP and optical
   layers.  This holistic view allows for the detection of complex
   issues that span multiple layers, such as optical signal impairments
   that could degrade IP data transmission quality.  By correlating data
   from both layers, AINetOps solution can provide insights into how
   changes in the optical layer might affect IP performance and vice
   versa.  This enables operators to take preemptive actions, such as
   optimizing signal paths or adjusting routing protocols, to maintain
   optimal network performance.</t>
          <t>The benefits of proactive network assurance and monitoring are
   substantial.  By identifying and addressing potential issues before
   they escalate, network operators can significantly reduce downtime
   and improve service reliability.  This proactive stance not only
   enhances the user experience by ensuring consistent network
   performance but also reduces operational costs associated with
   emergency troubleshooting and repairs.  Furthermore, the use of
   advanced analytics and machine learning in AIOps allows for
   continuous learning and improvement, enabling networks to become more
   resilient and adaptive over time.</t>
          <t>In today's dynamic and high-demand network environments, proactive
   network assurance and monitoring is one of the operational benefits
   provided by AINetOps and are essential for staying ahead of potential
   issues and maintaining a competitive edge.  By leveraging the power
   of AINetOp, network operators can transform their approach from
   reactive to proactive, ensuring that their networks are not only
   robust and resilient but also capable of delivering the high-quality
   service that users expect.  This shift towards proactive assurance
   represents a significant advancement in network management, paving
   the way for more intelligent, efficient, and reliable network
   operations.</t>

        <section anchor="anomaly-detection">
          <name>Anomaly Detection</name>
          <t>A critical component of AINetOps in the context of predictive
   analytics is "Anomaly Detection", which leverages advanced ML
   algorithms to enhance network reliability and performance.  By
   employing ML techniques such as supervised, unsupervised or
   reinforcement learning, AINetOps can predict anomalies in real-time
   by analyzing vast amounts of network telemetry data.  Supervised
   learning models, trained on historical data, recognize known issues,
   while unsupervised models identify new anomalies by spotting
   outliers.  This comprehensive detection mechanism ensures both
   familiar and novel network issues are identified promptly.
   Predictive models, utilizing techniques like time-series forecasting,
   enable the identification of potential network problems, such as link
   failures or traffic congestion, before they occur.  By forecasting
   future network states based on historical and current data, these
   models provide early warnings, allowing for timely interventions to
   prevent unexpected downtime and maintain optimal performance.</t>
          <t>Clustering techniques further enhance anomaly detection by grouping
   similar data points to identify patterns and trends that signal
   imminent failures or suboptimal behavior.  This method allows ML
   models to discern subtle changes in network behavior that might
   otherwise go unnoticed.  For example, clustering can reveal traffic
   congestion patterns under specific conditions, enabling preemptive
   measures to alleviate potential issues.  Additionally, clustering
   helps identify the root causes of anomalies by correlating various
   network events and metrics, facilitating a more effective
   troubleshooting process.  By integrating these advanced ML
   techniques, AINetOps not only improves anomaly detection but also
   empowers network operators with the insights needed to maintain a
   high-performing and reliable network infrastructure.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="trending-and-forecasting">
          <name>Trending and Forecasting</name>
          <t>"Trending and Forecasting" operational benefit is distinct but is
   related to "Anomaly Detection" Section 5.3.2.  Trending and
   forecasting in the context of single-layer or multi-layer IP optical
   networks are pivotal components of predictive analytics, providing
   significant operational benefits through AINetOps.  In single-layer
   networks, such as purely IP or optical networks, trending involves
   analyzing historical data to identify patterns and behaviors over
   time.  For instance, in an IP network, trends in traffic volume,
   latency, and packet loss can be monitored to predict future network
   performance and capacity needs.  Similarly, in an optical network,
   trends in signal quality, attenuation, and equipment performance can
   be tracked.  By leveraging these trends, predictive models can
   forecast potential issues such as bandwidth bottlenecks or equipment
   degradation, allowing network operators to proactively optimize
   resources, plan for upgrades, and prevent service disruptions.</t>
          <t>In multi-layer IP optical networks, where both IP and optical layers
   interact, trending and forecasting become even more powerful.  This
   approach involves correlating data from both layers to gain a
   comprehensive understanding of network behavior.  For example, trends
   in optical signal impairments can be analyzed alongside IP traffic
   patterns to predict how physical layer issues might impact data
   transmission and overall network performance.  Forecasting in this
   multi-layer context can identify potential cross-layer issues, such
   as how an increase in optical signal noise might lead to higher IP
   packet error rates.  By anticipating these issues, network operators
   can implement preemptive measures, such as rerouting traffic or
   adjusting signal parameters, to maintain seamless service.  The
   integration of trending and forecasting through AIOps thus enhances
   the resilience and efficiency of IP optical networks, ensuring
   superior performance and reliability.</t>

        <section anchor="predictive-maintenance">
          <name>Predictive Maintenance</name>
          <t>Predictive maintenance in the context of single-layer or multi-layer
   IP optical networks is other aspect of predictive analytics, offering
   substantial operational benefits through AINeetOps.  In single-layer
   networks, such as purely IP or optical networks, predictive
   maintenance involves using historical and real-time data to forecast
   when network components might fail or degrade.  For instance, in an
   IP network, data from routers and switches, such as CPU usage,
   temperature, and error rates, can be analyzed to predict hardware
   failures.  Similarly, in an optical network, monitoring parameters
   like signal strength, attenuation, and equipment performance helps
   predict when optical amplifiers or transceivers might need
   maintenance.  By accurately forecasting these maintenance needs,
   network operators can schedule interventions before failures occur,
   reducing unplanned downtime and extending the lifespan of network
   components.</t>
          <t>In multi-layer IP optical networks, predictive maintenance becomes
   even more effective by considering the interactions between the IP
   and optical layers.  This approach involves analyzing data from both
   layers to predict maintenance needs that could impact the entire
   network.  For example, if optical layer data indicates a gradual
   degradation in fiber quality, predictive models can assess how this
   might affect IP layer performance, such as increased packet loss or
   latency.  By understanding these cross-layer dependencies, network
   operators can prioritize maintenance activities that have the most
   significant impact on overall network health.  This proactive
   approach ensures that both layers of the network are maintained
   optimally, preventing cascading failures and maintaining high service
   quality.  Through the integration of predictive maintenance with
   AIOps, IP optical networks can achieve greater reliability,
   efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, ensuring uninterrupted service
   delivery to end-users.</t>

          <t>Predictive analytics also plays a crucial role in capacity planning
   and performance management.  By forecasting future traffic demands,
   network operators can ensure that the infrastructure is adequately
   scaled to meet those demands without over-provisioning.  This not
   only optimizes the use of resources but also ensures that the network
   can handle peak loads efficiently.  Additionally, predictive

        <name>Network Operational Insights</name>
        <t>"Network Operational Insights" refers to the comprehensive visibility
   and understanding of an IP optical network's performance and
   behavior.  This concept involves collecting and analyzing detailed
   data about the network's operations.  By providing this valuable
   insight to network operators, they can gain a holistic view of the
   network's health and performance.  This enables operators to
   understand their network better and ensure a robust and resilient
   infrastructure.</t>
        <t>By having a detailed understanding of network usage patterns, traffic
   flows, and performance metrics, operators can make data-driven
   decisions to optimize resource allocation and improve overall
   efficiency.  This insight is particularly valuable in multi-layer IP/
   Optical networks, where the interplay between different network
   layers can be complex. <xref target="RFC5557"/> provides examples of the PCE 
   being using to optimize resource allocation.</t>
        <t>By leveraging these insights, operators can
   ensure that both the IP and optical layers are operating
   harmoniously, leading to optimal performance and cost efficiency.  In
   essence, Network Operational Insights empower operators with the
   knowledge needed to maintain a high-performing, resilient, and
   future-proof network infrastructure.</t>
        <t>The network operational insight can be grouped into two categories.
   By categorizing network operational insights into these two
   categories, operators can better prioritize their efforts and
   resources, ensuring both immediate and long-term network health and
   performance.</t>
        <section anchor="operational-insights-requiring-no-further-analysis">
          <name>Operational Insights Requiring No Further Analysis</name>
          <t>Network Operational Insights that fall under this category are those
   that can be obtained directly from existing data and real-time
   monitoring without the need for further analysis or simulation.
   These insights provide immediate, actionable information that can
   help network operators quickly identify and address issues.</t>
          <t>These insights are typically derived from real-time monitoring
   systems that continuously track network performance and health
   metrics.  For example, showing the Network Element (NE) with the
   highest alarms or displaying the current alarm table for a specific
   NE (e.g., NE 1.1.1.1) can provide immediate visibility into potential
   issues.  Similarly, identifying the NEs with the highest problems
   during the last hour or plotting the Bit Error Rate (BER) for the 10
   worst modems in a specific region (e.g., Northeast) allows operators
   to quickly pinpoint areas that require attention.  These insights are
   crucial for maintaining network stability and ensuring prompt
   resolution of emerging issues.</t>
          <t>These insights also include detailed information about network
   components and their performance.  For instance, identifying which
   photonic services cross a specific fiber (e.g., OTS1) or determining
   which modems are in use for a particular optical service (e.g., SVC-
   1) can help operators understand the current network configuration
   and its operational status.  Additionally, insights such as the
   average time to failure for similar equipment in the network or
   identifying geographic regions with higher rates of network issues
   provide valuable context for proactive maintenance and resource
   planning.  By leveraging these direct insights, operators can
   maintain a well-functioning network with minimal downtime and optimal
   performance.</t>

        <section anchor="operational-insights-requiring-further-analysis">
          <name>Operational Insights Requiring Further Analysis</name>
          <t>Network Operational Insights in this category require deeper analysis
   and possibly simulation to derive meaningful conclusions.  These
   insights often involve complex scenarios where simple monitoring data
   is insufficient, and further investigation is needed to understand
   the underlying causes or to predict future behavior.</t>
          <t>Insights that require investigation and simulation often involve
   predictive analytics and scenario planning.  For example, determining
   whether an L0 optical service can be created between two cities
   (e.g., city A and Y) involves analyzing the current network topology,
   available resources, and potential constraints.  Similarly,
   understanding why an IP TE-tunnel cannot be established between two
   points (e.g., point A and B) may require simulation of different
   routing scenarios and examination of network policies.  These
   investigations help operators to not only troubleshoot current issues
   but also to plan and optimize future network expansions and
   configurations.</t>
          <t>These insights are crucial for long-term network health and
   performance optimization.  Identifying the most common failure points
   in the network or detecting signs of degradation in wireless network
   performance requires a combination of historical data analysis and
   predictive modeling.  By simulating different maintenance activities
   based on current network health, operators can prioritize tasks that
   will have the most significant impact.  For instance, understanding
   what maintenance activities are needed based on the current network
   health can help in scheduling proactive maintenance that prevents
   future outages.  These insights enable operators to take a strategic
   approach to network management, ensuring sustained performance and

      <section anchor="network-configuration-management">
        <name>Network Configuration Management</name>
        <t>AI can assist in automating the generation and enforcement of network
   configurations, significantly enhancing network reliability and
   performance.  By leveraging AI/Gen-AI algorithms, network operators
   can automate the creation of configuration templates that are
   precisely tailored to specific network requirements.  These templates
   can encompass a wide range of settings, such as Quality of Service
   (QoS) parameters, Access Control Lists (ACLs), tunnel configurations,
   and service configuration ensuring that each network segment is
   optimized for its intended purpose.  This automation not only speeds
   up the deployment process but also reduces the likelihood of human
   errors that can occur during manual configuration, leading to a more
   robust and efficient network infrastructure.</t>
        <t>Furthermore, AINetOps can play a role on validation of network
   configuration, i.e., "network configuration audit".  AINetOps plays a
   crucial role in validating configurations against predefined network
   configuration, ensuring that all network setups comply with intent
   configuration.  By continuously monitoring network configurations,
   AINetOps can detect and flag any deviations or misconfigurations that
   could pose security risks or operational inefficiencies.  For
   example, an AI system can identify inconsistencies in ACLs that might
   allow unauthorized access or detect suboptimal QoS settings that
   could degrade service quality.  By proactively addressing these
   issues, AINetOps helps maintain the integrity and performance of the
   network, enabling operators to focus on strategic initiatives rather

        <t>Another AINetOps operational benefits is "Traffic Optimization" where
   IP/Optical network traffic flows can be monitored and appropriate
   adjustments to network protocols, network topology, network
   configuration, load balancing, bandwidth allocation and so on can be
   dynamically initiated.  AINetOps traffic optimization considers
   multiple factors such as latency, packet loss, and link utilization,
   enabling networks to adapt to changing conditions in real time.</t>
        <t>Expanding on this, AINetOps traffic optimization leverages advanced
   algorithms to continuously monitor network conditions and predict
   potential congestion points before they impact service quality.  By
   analyzing historical data and real-time metrics, machine learning
   models can forecast traffic patterns and proactively adjust routing
   decisions to ensure optimal performance.  For instance, AINetOps can
   reroute traffic through less congested paths when high utilization is
   detected, balancing the load and enhancing overall network
   efficiency.  This intelligent management reduces latency and packet
   loss while maximizing bandwidth utilization.</t>
        <t>Furthermore, traffic optimization enhances the network's ability to
   respond to sudden changes in demand, such as peak usage times or
   unexpected traffic spikes.  Traditional static configurations may
   struggle with such fluctuations, leading to bottlenecks and degraded
   performance.  With AI, the network can dynamically reconfigure itself

        <t>Another significant operational benefit of implementing AINetOps in
   single-layer or multi-layer IP/Optical networks is the generation of
   various Network Controller APIs.  These APIs are essential for the
   seamless integration of network controllers (whether IP, Optical, or
   multi-layer) with Operational Support Systems (OSS) or other network
   controllers.  A key advantage of this operational benefit is that
   operators do not need to possess in-depth knowledge of the APIs.
   Typically, network operators spend considerable time creating and
   verifying APIs to integrate IP or Optical network elements with the
   broader management layer, including OSS/BSS.  By developing robust
   and versatile APIs, network operators can ensure smooth communication
   and coordination between different network management systems,
   thereby enhancing overall network efficiency and performance</t>
        <t>The APIs developed for network controllers serve as a bridge,

spanning from the definition of APIs that can be used by the various agent to the
interworking with already existing components of the Network Management and Control stack.
New challenges arise when we move from a single agent to a multi-agent architecture.
When multiple agents are deployed we need to consider how they discover each other, 
how they interwork with the discovered agents and how they are kept in synch.</t>
        <t>The discovery aspect could be relatively simple in the short term, when few agents will
be deployed in the network and it could be possible to manually configure each agent

        <name>Network Active and Reactive Assurance</name>
        <t>Network active and reactive assurance, both at the single-
   layer (IP or Optical) and multi-layer (IP over Optical), are critical
   components in maintaining the health and stability of modern IP,
   Optical, and IPoDWDM networks.  This process involves the
   identification and resolution of network issues as they arise,
   ensuring that any disruptions or degradations are promptly addressed.
   By employing AINetOps techniques, network engineers can quickly
   pinpoint the root cause of problems, whether they originate in the IP
   layer, the optical layer, or across both.  This reactive approach is
   essential for minimizing downtime and maintaining the quality of
   service expected by network users.</t>
        <t>In single-layer troubleshooting, the focus is on isolating and
   resolving issues within a specific layer of the network.  Multi-layer
   troubleshooting, on the other hand, requires a more integrated
   approach, as it involves identifying and resolving issues that span
   across multiple layers of the network.  This could include problems
   where an issue in the optical layer affects the IP layer.</t>
        <t>In both reactive and active assurance, network faults have already occurred. These faults may include impairments such as optical fiber cuts, IP packet drops, IP link latency issues, or Threshold Crossing Alarms (TCA), among others.</t>
        <t>As illustrated in <xref target="_figure-reactive-assurance"/>, reactive assurance assumes that a fault occurs in the IP/Optical network (Step A) and is subsequently detected by the operator through various means (Step B). Detection methods may include alarm monitoring, performance telemetry data analysis, or customer reports indicating service disruptions. To initiate troubleshooting, the operator can launch the AIOps-Assistant, which acts as the front-end interface for AINetOps (Step C). The assistant then utilizes the backend assurance and troubleshooting mechanisms, leveraging a Gen-AI multi-agent framework. In Step D, a dynamic workflow is executed to diagnose the issue and identify potential root causes. Optionally, at Step E, the Gen-AI dynamic workflow can recommend remedial actions to resolve the issue and implement these actions in a closed-loop fashion, ensuring automated network recovery.</t>

        <name>Network Pro-active Assurance</name>
        <t>Unlike reactive and active assurance, proactive assurance does not wait for a fault to occur in the IP/Optical network. Instead, the network is continuously monitored through a series of trending and forecasting processes designed to detect early signs of deterioration that may eventually lead to faults.</t>
        <t>As illustrated in <xref target="_figure-proactive-assurance"/>, achieving proactive assurance involves running multiple processes that continuously monitor network performance. These processes collect and analyze a wide array of network telemetry data, including performance monitoring (PM) data, alarms, logs, network topology, and inventory details (Step A). By employing various techniques including advanced AI/ML algorithms, these processes provide real-time trending and forecasting insights, identifying patterns and anomalies that could indicate potential degradation (Step B).</t>
        <t>When these background processes detect any signs of deterioration or anomalous behavior, they trigger the AIOps-Assistant for further investigation (Step C). The AIOps-Assistant then leverages a Gen-AI multi-agent framework to initiate the assurance and troubleshooting procedures. In Step D, a dynamic workflow is executed to thoroughly diagnose the emerging issue and identify potential root causes. Optionally, at Step E, the Gen-AI dynamic workflow can recommend remedial actions to resolve the identified issues. These recommendations can be implemented in a closed-loop fashion, ensuring automated network recovery and continuous improvement of network performance. This proactive approach not only mitigates the risk of unexpected network faults but also optimizes operational efficiency by addressing issues before they escalate into service-impacting events.</t>
        <t>Furthermore, by integrating advanced analytics with automated corrective measures, proactive assurance enhances overall network resilience. It enables network operators to maintain a high quality of service and reliability, even in complex and dynamic network environments.</t>

      <section anchor="network-anomaly-detection">
        <name>Network Anomaly Detection</name>
        <t>Network anomaly detection is a critical component of modern network security and management, aimed at identifying deviations from normal network behavior that may indicate potential threats or operational issues. With the increasing complexity of networks and the growing    sophistication of cyber threats, traditional rule-based detection methods are often insufficient. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques offers a more dynamic and adaptive approach to detecting anomalies in real-time. This section outlines the architecture, interfaces, protocols, data models, and alignment with IETF standards necessary to implement an effective AI-driven network anomaly detection system. The design and implementation of such systems may use some relevant technologies, such as RFC 8345 (YANG Data Model for Network Topologies), RFC 6241 (NETCONF Protocol), and RFC 8529 (YANG Schema Mount).</t>
        <t>Machine learning would provide a key function in network anomaly detection as it can be seamlessly integrated into the architecture, via the âAnalysis Layerâ described in the figure above. By leveraging ML techniques, it would be possible to identify deviations from normal behavior, uncovering anomalies that might be imperceptible to human network engineers.</t>
        <t>An ML technique using unsupervised learning is particularly well-suited for network anomaly detection, as the network infrastructure is typically dynamic and evolving by nature. While machine learning requires large volumes of high-quality data and substantial computational resources for training, its benefits outweigh these challenges. Machine learning models offer generalizability, robustness, and reduced dependence on manual fine-tuning. More importantly, they enable the detection of complex and previously unseen anomaly patterns, enhancing network security, reliability, and operational efficiency.</t>

          <li>
            <t>Architecture  </t>
            <t>
The architecture for network anomaly detection using AI typically involves a distributed system where data collection, analysis, and    response mechanisms are decoupled but interconnected. The system comprises the following key components:  </t>
            <t>
o Data Collection Layer: Responsible for gathering network traffic data from various sources such as routers, switches, and endpoints. 
   This layer may leverage protocols like IPFIX (RFC 7011) for flow data export.  </t>
            <t>
o Analysis Layer: Utilizes machine learning (ML) models to detect anomalies in the collected data. This layer may include both real-time and batch processing capabilities.  </t>
            <t>
o Response Layer: Executes predefined actions based on the analysis results, such as alerting administrators, blocking malicious traffic,or reconfiguring network devices. This layer may integrate with DOTS (RFC 8811) to mitigate DDoS attacks.  </t>
            <t>
The architecture should be scalable to handle large volumes of data and adaptable to incorporate new AI models as they evolve.  </t>

        <t>The operation of IP and optical networks comprises a wide range of management, monitoring and optimization tasks, including equipment configuration (switches, routers, OTNs, etc.), implementation of network policies, fault detection, troubleshooting, and capacity planning. The execution of such tasks usually requires access,  comprehension and analysis of specific documentation containing information about network topologies, hardware inventory, vendor specifications, and pre-defined procedures.</t>
        <t>Given the capacity of LLMs to understand natural language, including technical jargon, and their ability to process large amounts of information in short times, they can be used to build useful tools that support the network operational work, by executing comprehensive cognitive searches through the different documentation available to the operational teams, providing fast and concrete answers to technical enquiries, and making the access to such information a more efficient and interactive process.</t>
        <t>To provision an LLM with such knowledge requires either a fine-tuning training job, that retrains an existing LLM, or the implementation of a RAG based architecture, where the information coming from the documentation is stored in a knowledge base and provided as context to the LLM. For this scenario, the RAG based approach has some specific advantages like lower computational cost, faster deployment, no need of retraining when the documentation is updated, and easier scalability.</t>
        <t>Therefore, it is often the default approach for this type of solutions. Next section provides an architectural overview of how a RAG based system can be implemented to provide cognitive  search for network operations.</t>

          <li>
            <t>Architecture  </t>
            <t>
In a RAG based architecture, a knowledge base is created by using an embedding model capable of splitting and transforming the content of different documents into numerical representations (vectors), and storing them in a data base, also known as Vector Data Base. The general process executed by the system every time a query is made by a user can be summarized in the following steps:  </t>
            <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
                <t>Retrieval: The query made by the user is transformed by the embedding model and used to search and retrieve relevant information from the Vector Data Base.</t>
              </li>
              <li>
                <t>Augmentation: The information retrieved from the Vector Data Base is used to augment the query made by the user, adding context that might be unknown to the LLM.</t>
              </li>
              <li>
                <t>Generation: The augmented query is sent to the LLM, which then generates and answer in natural language that is finally delivered to the user.</t>

        <t>Several innovations have been developed at the IETF for multi-layer network (MLN) planning. This activity is involves coordinating and optimizing multiple network layers, such as IP, optical, and transport layers, to improve efficiency, resilience, and scalability. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has developed several technologies and standards to facilitate multi-layer network planning, including protocols for path computation, topology exchange, and resource optimization.</t>
        <t>The components and interfaces for MLN planning include:</t>

            <t>Architecture  </t>
            <t>
The Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) ACTN <xref target="RFC8453"/> architecture provides a framework for virtualized network resource control and abstraction, enabling efficient multi-layer coordination between packet and optical networks. It defines key functional components like the Multi-Domain Coordinator (MDSC), which facilitates policy-based control and end-to-end service planning and provisioning.</t>

The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a fundamental component of a Software Defined Networking (SDN) system, responsible for computing optimal traffic paths and dynamically adjusting them based on network conditions or demand. Originally designed for deriving paths for MPLS, and GMPLS, Label Switched Paths (LSPs), PCE delivers these computed routes to the LSP's head end via the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).  </t>
            <t>
The PCE architecture <xref target="RFC4655"/> enables efficient path computation for traffic-engineered networks by offloading complex calculations to a dedicated entity. Stateful PCE <xref target="RFC8051"/> and <xref target="RFC8231"/> extends the PCE framework by maintaining real-time network state awareness, allowing dynamic path optimization across layers. The Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) <xref target="RFC6805"/> architecture supports multi-layer and multi-domain path computation by allowing collaboration between multiple PCEs.</t>

The YANG data modeling language is a cornerstone for MLN planning.

Several IETF YANG models provide network topology, traffic engineering, optical transport, and service abstraction.  </t>
            <t>
A core YANG model for MLN planning is the Network Topology Model <xref target="RFC8345"/>, which provides a generic framework for representing network nodes, links, and supporting attributes. This model would facilitate an AI-enabled planning system to define multi-layer relationships, such as the mapping between optical, ethernet, and IP layers, enabling a holistic approach to MLN planning.</t>

        <name>Multi Agent Interworking</name>
        <t>As briefly introduced in chapter 5, effectively deploying multiple AI agents for network management introduces significant interworking challenges that must be addressed for successful and reliable operation. These challenges span several key areas:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
            <t>Communication and Coordination:  Multiple agents operating in a shared network environment
  need to communicate effectively to coordinate their actions.  This includes sharing information
  about network state, learned models, and planned interventions.  A lack of standardized
  protocols and data models can lead to the need to deploy expensive and time consuming adaptation
  layers.  It is also extremely important to determine the appropriate communication frequency
  and granularity to avoid overloading the communication network between them while keeping
  a sufficient level of details to avoid suboptimal or even harmful decisions due to incomplete information.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Conflict Resolution and Decision Fusion:  When multiple agents are responsible for overlapping
  or interdependent network functions, conflicts in their decisions are inevitable.  For example,
  one agent might decide to reroute traffic to alleviate congestion, while another agent
  simultaneously decides to scale down resources in the same area.  Effective conflict resolution
  mechanisms are needed to prioritize actions, negotiate solutions, and ensure that the overall
  impact on the network is positive.  This requires defining clear roles and responsibilities
  for each agent, establishing decision fusion strategies, and potentially incorporating a central
  arbitration mechanism, like for example in the case of coordination of multiple PCEs. Furthermore,
  handling conflicting information from different agents, potentially due to noisy or incomplete data,
  requires robust data validation and aggregation techniques.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Consistency and Stability:  The dynamic nature of networks requires agents to continuously learn and
  adapt.  However, independent learning by multiple agents can lead to inconsistencies in their
  learned models and behaviors, potentially causing instability in the network.  For example,
  different agents might learn different optimal routing strategies, leading to oscillations
  and unpredictable network performance.  Mechanisms for sharing learned knowledge, synchronizing models,
  and ensuring convergence towards a stable and consistent global state are essential.
  This could involve techniques like federated learning or distributed consensus protocols.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Trust and Security:  In a multi-agent environment, trust and security become critical concerns.
  Agents might be vulnerable to malicious attacks or faulty behavior, which can compromise the entire network.
  Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms are needed to ensure that only legitimate agents
  can access and control network resources. Establishing trust between agents, potentially through
  reputation systems or blockchain technologies, can also enhance the overall security and resilience of the network.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Scalability and Management:  As the number of agents and the complexity of the network increase,
  managing the interactions between agents becomes increasingly challenging.  Scalable architectures
  and management frameworks are needed to handle the growing communication overhead, coordination complexity,
  and resource requirements. One possible option to overcome this problem could be leveraging on a
  hierarchical agent structure. As previously introduced, in order to allow for scalability, it is also
  important to foresee advertisement protocols/extensions to let the agents learn about their counterparts
  and their capabilities.  </t>
            <t>
Addressing these interworking challenges is essential for realizing the full potential of AI agents in network management. Developing standardized protocols, robust coordination mechanisms, and scalable management frameworks will pave the way for autonomous networks.</t>

        <t>Flow placement, traffic engineering/steering along with network resource defragmentation are among important aspects of network operations that can benefit from artificial intelligence.</t>
        <t>Network routing protocols automate flow placement for best-effort traffic.  Traffic engineering and steering are commonly based on statistical analysis and historical trends of network traffic. They are mostly implemented via configurations and tunnel setups, often employing scripts for automation purposes.</t>
        <t>While there are some proactive approach to network resource defragmentation, reactive methods are still quite common.  There are short-term approaches and longer-term views on employing AI to address traffic management.</t>
        <section anchor="short-term-approaches">
          <name>Short term approaches</name>
          <t>In the short-term, AI models train on operator's network traffic patterns and employ a set of APIs to connect to network configuration equipment in order to add, remove, and modify configurations and perform different traffic management related tasks. Model training can be either off-line or on-line.</t>
          <t>Initially, AI models perform their inference tasks exclusively based on their training on historical network traffic patterns, and topology changes in a centralized manner.  In more advanced approaches, the models not only train on network traffic patterns, and network topology changes, but also  learn how to interpret and digest external events. This added capability allows the AI models to be more effective in performing their traffic management tasks.</t>
          <t>Generally speaking, IETF/IRTF can work on describing and providing synthetic networks along with synthetic traffic that can be used to train AI models. Furthermore, IETF/IRTF can also define and provide expected reasonable traffic flows.</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>Offline training  </t>
              <t>
During off-line training, external events, network monitoring information (available via protocols such as SNMP), historical data from traffic engineering  databases, network topology changes, and other traffic-related data from the operator's network are collected over time. This data is then used later  during the training and model performance evaluation process.  </t>
              <t>
There is potential to define a set of APIs to collect information or enable a query mechanism to pull the required training data, particularly for external events.  </t>
              <t>
Selecting the important features from the entire dataset is another crucial aspect of training.  </t>
              <t>
IETF/IRTF can certainly play a role in both of the above-mentioned cases.</t>

              <t>
Online training takes a more real-time approach. Here model training is based on processing data incrementally as it becomes available. This method is particularly suitable for scenarios such as network traffic management which require real-time learning and adaptation to changes.  </t>
              <t>
A traffic management AI model under online training uses the same input sources as it does in offline training. However, unlike offline training, the data here is not stored in a repository but streamed into the training process. As such, the ground truth for model performance evaluation in online training is derived from observation of actual real time world events and network behavior, rather than stored data.  </t>
              <t>
The training process therefore requires a mechanism to extract important features from the stream of incoming real-time network data and outside world events. These extracted features are then fed to the training process for adjusting model's parameters in a dynamic manner.  </t>
              <t>
IETF/IRTF can work to standardize the mechanisms to identify important feature and implement the above mentioned required real-time data delivery and feature extraction.</t>

          <t>Over time, the full integration of AI models and network elements will transform networks from their current state into agent-based or Agentic networks. In a distributed version of Agentic networks, each node is accompanied by an AI agents. Once trained, these agents work together to address flow placement, traffic steering/engineering, and other network related tasks such as traffic management, network resource defragmentation, and even routing.</t>
          <t>While being different from networks managed by a set of interworking multi agents , the Agentic networks face some of the same challenges outlined in the multi agent interworking section of the document. However, in Agentic networks, distributed training of the agents and proper knowledge sharing between them can enhance their collective training performance and can potentially alleviate some of these difficulties.</t>
          <t>In these networks, AI agents trained on local traffic patterns and external events will exchange knowledge and network state information through a set of protocols in a distributed manner in order to address network related tasks. Agentic networks will potentially offer highly automated, streamlined, and tunnel-less traffic management that is currently available only for best-effort traffic.</t>

        <t>This use case leverages AI to design and execute fault injection
   scenarios that test the resilience of IP/optical networks under
   simulated failure conditions. By proactively introducing controlled
   disruptions-such as packet drops, latency spikes, or optical signal
   degradation-AI assesses the network's ability to detect, respond, 
   and recover from faults. This approach enhances network robustness 
   by identifying weaknesses and validating automated recovery 
   mechanisms before real failures occur, addressing both single-layer
   (IP or optical) and multi-layer (IP over optical) scenarios.</t>
        <t>The AI system analyzes historical failure data (e.g., fiber cuts,
   equipment outages), real-time telemetry (e.g., latency, BER), and
   external factors (e.g., weather events, traffic surges) to model
   probable failure points. It then injects faults, monitors the
   network's response, and refines recovery strategies, potentially in a
   closed-loop manner. For example, an AI model might predict a high-risk
   optical link based on trending attenuation, simulate a fiber cut, and
   evaluate whether IP-layer rerouting maintains SLAs. If recovery is
   suboptimal, it suggests adjustments (e.g., updating TE policies) and
   retests.</t>

The AI Fault Injection Engine interfaces with network controllers
 using standard management and telemetry APIs. NETCONF (RFC 6241) or
 RESTCONF (RFC 8040) enables fault injection by sending commands to
 disable interfaces, drop packets, or adjust optical parameters (e.g.,
 signal power). Real-time telemetry is collected via gNMI (gRPC Network
 Management Interface) or OpenConfig streams, providing metrics like
 latency, packet loss, and Bit Error Rate (BER). External data sources
 (e.g., weather APIs, threat intelligence feeds) may integrate via REST
 APIs to enrich fault scenario design.</t>

            <t>Protocols  </t>
            <t>
Several IETF protocols support this use case. PCEP (RFC 5440)
 extensions could enable dynamic path recomputation during fault
 scenarios, testing traffic engineering resilience. BGP (RFC 4271) or
 OSPF (RFC 2328) adjustments validate routing protocol stability under
 simulated failures. For optical layers, OTN (G.709) or ASON (G.8080)
 signaling protocols facilitate fault injection (e.g., simulating fiber
 cuts). Telemetry protocols like IPFIX (RFC 7011) or SNMP (RFC 3411)
 provide feedback data, though streaming alternatives (e.g., gNMI) are
 preferred for real-time needs.</t>

YANG models are central to representing fault injection and resilience
 data. The base Network Topology Model (RFC 8345) can be extended with
 new YANG modules to define fault parameters (e.g., failure type,
 duration, scope) and resilience metrics (e.g., recovery time, SLA
 compliance). OpenConfig YANG models for interfaces (e.g.,
 openconfig-interfaces) and optical transport (e.g.,
 openconfig-terminal-device) support fault execution and telemetry
 collection. A new YANG model may be needed to standardize fault

The process begins with AI training on historical failure data,
 synthetic scenarios, and real-time network state, using ML techniques
 like supervised learning for fault prediction and reinforcement
 learning for recovery optimization. Fault injection tests are
 scheduled (e.g., off-peak) or triggered on-demand, with operator
 oversight via an AIOps-Assistant interface (similar to 6.8). Post-test
 analysis generates reports on resilience gaps, updates network
 policies (e.g., QoS, routing), and refines the AI model's training
 dataset. Closed-loop automation may execute recovery actions
 autonomously, validated by subsequent tests.</t>

 applications in networking, providing a foundation for fault injection
 methodologies. The Traffic Engineering Architecture and Signaling
 (TEAS) working group's work on resilience and path computation (e.g.,
 RFC 8453 for ACTN) supports multi-layer testing. Extensions to YANG

        <t>This use case employs AI to optimize energy consumption across IP/optical
   networks by dynamically adjusting network resources based on traffic
   demand, equipment performance, and environmental conditions. With
   routers, switches, and optical amplifiers contributing significantly to
   power usage, AI-driven energy management reduces operational costs and
   carbon footprints while maintaining performance and reliability. It
   addresses both single-layer (IP or optical) and multi-layer (IP over

        <t>The AI system analyzes real-time telemetry (e.g., power usage, link
   utilization), historical patterns (e.g., peak/off-peak traffic), and
   external factors (e.g., electricity costs, cooling needs) to identify
   energy-saving opportunities. Actions include powering down idle ports,
   rerouting traffic to consolidate active paths, tuning optical signal
   parameters, or scheduling high-energy tasks during low-cost periods. For

 optimize routing efficiency. For optical layers, OTN (G.709) signaling
 tunes power settings (e.g., lowering laser output). Telemetry protocols

   (e.g., latency, throughput) are met. As networks increasingly rely on
   distributed compute elements like Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) or

        <t>The AI system analyzes real-time telemetry (e.g., latency, traffic load),

        <t>This use case leverages AI to optimize the creation, management, and
   performance of network slices in 5G and beyond. By dynamically
   allocating resources, predicting SLA violations, and coordinating
   across multiple domains, AI ensures that each slice meets its
   performance requirements while efficiently utilizing the underlying
   physical infrastructure. This use case addresses both single-domain
   (e.g., RAN) and multi-domain (e.g., RAN, transport, core) scenarios.</t>
        <t>The AI system analyzes real-time telemetry (e.g., traffic patterns,
   resource utilization), historical data, and external inputs (e.g.,
   service requirements, network topology) to optimize network slices.
   For example, AI can allocate additional bandwidth to a slice
   experiencing high traffic or reroute traffic to prevent congestion.
   If SLA violations are predicted, AI can take proactive measures
   (e.g., scaling resources, adjusting configurations) to ensure
   compliance.</t>

            <t>Interfaces and APIs  </t>
            <t>
The AI engine interfaces with the NSMF using standard management and
 telemetry APIs. The NSMF communicates with the NSSMFs using 3GPP-
 defined interfaces (e.g., Nsmf_PDUSession_Create,
 Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe). The AI engine collects telemetry via
 gNMI or OpenConfig streams and provides optimization recommendations
 to the NSMF via REST APIs.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Protocols  </t>
            <t>
The protocols align with 3GPP and IETF standards. The NSMF and NSSMFs
 use 3GPP-defined protocols (e.g., HTTP/2 for service-based
 interfaces). For transport, protocols like PCEP (RFC 5440) and BGP
 (RFC 4271) support traffic engineering adjustments. Telemetry
 protocols like IPFIX (RFC 7011) or SNMP (RFC 3411) provide feedback,
 with streaming alternatives (e.g., gNMI) preferred for real-time
 needs.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Data Models  </t>
            <t>
YANG models are central to representing slice configurations and
 performance data. The Network Topology Model (RFC 8345) can be
 extended to define slice parameters (e.g., latency, bandwidth) and
 metrics (e.g., resource utilization, SLA compliance). 3GPP YANG
 models for RAN, Core, and Transport support configuration and
 telemetry. A new YANG model may standardize network slicing
 optimization workflows.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Processes and Procedures  </t>
            <t>
The process begins with AI training on historical traffic data, slice
 configurations, and SLA requirements. Optimization runs continuously,
 with operator oversight via an AIOps-Assistant (similar to 6.8).
 Post-optimization, the AI evaluates slice performance, updates
 configurations, and retrains as needed. Closed-loop automation
 applies corrective actions, validated by telemetry.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Alignment with IETF and 3GPP  </t>
            <t>
This use case aligns with 3GPP efforts in network slicing and IETF
 efforts in network management and traffic engineering. The Operations
 and Management Area Working Group (OPSAWG) supports telemetry for
 slice performance metrics, while the Traffic Engineering Architecture
 and Signaling (TEAS) working group's work on path optimization (e.g.,
 RFC 8453 for ACTN) enables slice-aware routing. Extensions to YANG
 (NETMOD), PCEP (PCE), and telemetry standards (OPSAWG) could
 standardize this use case, leveraging frameworks proposed in
 <xref target="ai_drive_resilience_testing"/> and
 <xref target="energy_efficiency_optimization"/>.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) allows Path Computation Clients (PCCs) to request path computations from Path Computation Elements (PCEs), and lets the PCEs return responses. When computing or reoptimizing the routes of a set of Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) through a network, it may be advantageous to perform bulk path computations in order to avoid blocking problems and to achieve more optimal network-wide solutions. Such bulk optimization is termed Global Concurrent Optimization (GCO). A GCO is able to simultaneously consider the entire topology of the network and the complete set of existing TE LSPs, and their respective constraints, and look to optimize or reoptimize the entire network to satisfy all constraints for all TE LSPs. A GCO may also be applied to some subset of the TE LSPs in a network. The GCO application is primarily a Network Management System (NMS) solution.</t>

            <t>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks. The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for machine- to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.</t>
            <t>CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained environments.</t>

            <t>Traffic Engineered (TE) networks have a variety of mechanisms to facilitate the separation of the data plane and control plane. They also have a range of management and provisioning protocols to configure and activate network resources. These mechanisms represent key technologies for enabling flexible and dynamic networking. The term "Traffic Engineered network" refers to a network that uses any connection-oriented technology under the control of a distributed or centralized control plane to support dynamic provisioning of end-to- end connectivity.</t>
            <t>Abstraction of network resources is a technique that can be applied to a single network domain or across multiple domains to create a single virtualized network that is under the control of a network operator or the customer of the operator that actually owns the network resources.</t>
            <t>This document provides a framework for Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) to support virtual network services and connectivity services.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block for traffic engineering systems such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. Path computation in large, multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer networks is complex and may require special computational components and cooperation between the different network domains.</t>
            <t>This document specifies the architecture for a Path Computation Element (PCE)-based model to address this problem space. This document does not attempt to provide a detailed description of all the architectural components, but rather it describes a set of building blocks for the PCE architecture from which solutions may be constructed. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

            <t>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information about Label Switched Path (LSP) characteristics and resource usage within a network in order to provide traffic-engineering calculations for its associated Path Computation Clients (PCCs). This document describes general considerations for a stateful PCE deployment and examines its applicability and benefits, as well as its challenges and limitations, through a number of use cases.

          <title>The Application of the Path Computation Element Architecture to the Determination of a Sequence of Domains in MPLS and GMPLS</title>

          <abstract>
            <t>Computing optimum routes for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) across multiple domains in MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and GMPLS networks presents a problem because no single point of path computation is aware of all of the links and resources in each domain. A solution may be achieved using the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture.</t>
            <t>Where the sequence of domains is known a priori, various techniques can be employed to derive an optimum path. If the domains are simply connected, or if the preferred points of interconnection are also known, the Per-Domain Path Computation technique can be used. Where there are multiple connections between domains and there is no preference for the choice of points of interconnection, the Backward-Recursive PCE-based Computation (BRPC) procedure can be used to derive an optimal path.</t>
            <t>This document examines techniques to establish the optimum path when the sequence of domains is not known in advance. The document shows how the PCE architecture can be extended to allow the optimum sequence of domains to be selected, and the optimum end-to-end path to be derived through the use of a hierarchical relationship between domains. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>
