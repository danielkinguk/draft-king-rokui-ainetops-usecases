   The IETF and IRTF play a critical role in defining the protocols,
   architectures, and standards that underpin global networking.  As
   AINetOps becomes integral to network operations, there is a growing
   need to evaluate how existing IETF technologies can support AINetOps
   use cases and to identify gaps that may require new or extended
   solutions.  This document aims to outline key AINetOps use cases,
   highlight associated technical challenges, and propose requirements
   for protocols and architectures to address these challenges
   effectively.

   The use cases considered in this document span multiple aspects of
   network operations, including reactive troubleshooting, proactive
   assurance (e.g., anomaly detection, predictive maintenance), closed-
   loop optimization, and misconfiguration detection.  Emerging

5.1.  Operator Network Assistance

   Powered by Gen-AI, the operator network assistant functions as a
   virtual network engineer, providing a real-time recommendations,
   insights, and automated solutions.  These systems use NLP for
   interface interaction, deep learning for anomaly classification, and
   contextual understanding to enhance operator decision-making.

   AI-powered operator assistants function as virtual network engineers,
   providing real-time recommendations, insights, and automated
   solutions.  These advanced systems leverage the power of natural
   language processing (NLP) to facilitate seamless and intuitive
   interactions between operators and the network management interface.
   By understanding and interpreting human language, these AI assistants
   can effectively communicate with operators, making it easier for them
   to manage complex network environments without needing extensive
   technical expertise.

   In addition to NLP, Operator Assistance can integrate other AINetOps
   functions to solve operators scenarios and use-cases.  This
   capability allows the system to provide timely alerts and
   recommendations, helping operators to address issues before they
   escalate into major disruptions.  The deep learning models
   continuously improve over time, becoming more adept at recognizing
   new types of anomalies and adapting to evolving network conditions.

   Furthermore, the contextual understanding capabilities of AI-powered
   operator network assistant significantly enhance operator decision-
   making.  By considering the broader context of network operations,
   including historical data, current network state, and external
   factors, the AI can offer more relevant and actionable insights.
   This holistic approach ensures that operators receive comprehensive
   guidance tailored to the specific circumstances of their network.  As
   a result, operators can make more informed decisions, optimize
   network performance, and maintain high levels of service reliability
   and efficiency.  In essence, AI-powered operator network assistants
   are transforming network management by augmenting human capabilities
   with advanced technology, leading to smarter and more proactive
   network operations.

5.2.  Network active and reactive assurance

   Network active and reactive assurance and troubleshooting, both at
   the single- layer (IP or Optical) and multi-layer (IP over Optical),
   are critical components in maintaining the health and stability of
   modern IP, Optical, and IPoDWDM networks.  This process involves the
   identification and resolution of network issues as they arise,
   ensuring that any disruptions or degradations are promptly addressed.
   By employing AINetOps techniques, network engineers can quickly
   pinpoint the root cause of problems, whether they originate in the IP
   layer, the optical layer, or across both.  This reactive approach is
   essential for minimizing downtime and maintaining the quality of
   service expected by network users.

   In single-layer troubleshooting, the focus is on isolating and
   resolving issues within a specific layer of the network.  For
   example, in an IP network, this might involve diagnosing routing
   problems, addressing IP address conflicts, IP layer misconfiguration,
   hardware failure or resolving issues with network protocols.  In an
   optical network, single-layer troubleshooting could involve
   identifying fiber cuts, optical signal degradation, or equipment
   failures

   Multi-layer troubleshooting, on the other hand, requires a more
   integrated approach, as it involves identifying and resolving issues
   that span across multiple layers of the network.  This could include
   problems where an issue in the optical layer affects the IP layer,
   such as signal impairments that impact data transmission quality.  By
   effectively managing both single-layer and multi-layer
   troubleshooting, network engineers can ensure a more robust and
   resilient network infrastructure.

   The importance of assurance and troubleshooting cannot be overstated
   in today's high-demand network environments.  Rapid response to
   network issues is crucial to maintaining service continuity and
   meeting the expectations of end-users.  Advanced diagnostic tools and
   techniques, such as real-time monitoring, automated alerts, and
   detailed analytics, play a vital role in this process.  These tools
   enable engineers to quickly detect anomalies, assess their impact,
   and implement corrective actions.  Through continuous improvement of
   assurance and troubleshooting practices, network operators can
   enhance their ability to maintain network performance, reduce
   operational risks, and deliver a reliable and high-quality service to
   their customers.

5.2.1.  Root Cause Analysis

   In the context of "Network active and reactive assurance," Root Cause
   Analysis (RCA) is a critical aspect that extends the reactive
   troubleshooting process to uncover the underlying reasons behind
   network issues.  When an issue is detected in the network, RCA
   leverages advanced AINetOps techniques to correlate events across
   different layers of the network, whether it be IP, Optical, or a
   combination of both.  This comprehensive approach ensures that the
   root cause of an issue is accurately identified, rather than just
   addressing the symptoms.  Techniques such as graph-based analysis
   enable network engineers to visualize and trace the sequence of
   events leading to a problem, providing a clear pathway to the source
   of the issue.

   Moreover, natural language processing (NLP) for log analysis plays a
   significant role in RCA by automating the examination of vast amounts
   of log data generated by network devices.  NLP can sift through logs
   to identify patterns and anomalies that might be missed by manual
   inspection.  This capability is particularly useful in multi-layer
   networks where issues in one layer can propagate and manifest in
   another.  By efficiently parsing through logs and correlating data,
   NLP helps pinpoint the exact cause of disruptions, thereby reducing
   the mean time to resolution (MTTR).  Additionally, knowledge graph
   representations provide a structured and interconnected view of
   network components and their relationships, aiding in the rapid
   identification of fault points and their impact on the network.

   By accurately diagnosing the root cause of network issues, network
   operators can implement targeted corrective actions that address the
   core problem, preventing recurrence and ensuring long-term stability.
   This precision in troubleshooting not only minimizes downtime but
   also enhances the overall reliability and performance of the network.
   Furthermore, insights gained from RCA can inform proactive measures
   and optimization strategies, contributing to a more resilient network



Rokui, et al.            Expires 10 August 2025                [Page 10]

   infrastructure.  In essence, RCA empowers network engineers with the
   tools and knowledge needed to maintain high service quality and meet
   the demands of modern, high-performance networks.

5.3.  Predictive Analytics

   Predictive analytics or advanced analytics uses historical and real-
   time network data, statistical algorithms, and ML techniques to
   identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on past data.  In
   the context of network operations, predictive analytics involves the
   use of these methodologies in following areas to anticipate network
   issues, optimize performance, and improve operational efficiency.  By
   examining patterns and trends in historical network data, predictive
   analytics can potentially forecast network problems before they
   occur, allowing for proactive management and maintenance.

   The core idea behind predictive analytics is to transform data into
   actionable insights.  For network operations, this means analyzing
   various metrics such as traffic patterns, latency, performance
   management (PM) data, and equipment performance to predict future
   states of the network.  For instance, by identifying trends that have
   historically led to network failures, predictive analytics can alert
   operators to potential future failures, enabling them to take
   preventive measures.  This proactive approach helps in minimizing
   downtime, enhancing service reliability, and optimizing resource
   allocation.

   In summary, predictive analytics in network operations is about
   leveraging historical data and advanced analytical techniques to
   foresee and address potential issues before they impact the network.
   This approach leads to more efficient, reliable, and secure network
   operations, ultimately enhancing the overall performance and user
   experience.  The AINetOps can address the following operator's
   scenarios.

5.3.1.  Proactive Network Assurance and Monitoring (Health Check)

   Proactive Network Assurance and Monitoring represents a paradigm
   shift from the Network active and reactive assurance discussed in
   Section 5.2.  Instead of waiting for issues to arise and then
   addressing them, proactive network assurance involves anticipating
   potential problems and implementing measures to prevent them from
   occurring.  This forward-thinking strategy leverages AINetOps to
   predict and mitigate network issues before they impact service
   quality.






Rokui, et al.            Expires 10 August 2025                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft             AINetOps Use Cases              February 2025


   In single-layer proactive assurance, the focus is on continuously
   monitoring and analyzing the health of a specific layer IP or Optical
   layer of the network to identify early warning signs of potential
   issues.  For instance, in an IP network, this might involve analyzing
   traffic patterns to detect anomalies that could indicate an impending
   routing problem or hardware failure.  ML algorithms can be employed
   to predict IP address conflicts or protocol misconfigurations before
   they cause disruptions.  Similarly, in an optical network, proactive
   assurance could involve monitoring signal quality and fiber integrity
   to detect and address degradations before they lead to significant
   impairments or outages.

   Multi-layer proactive assurance takes this approach a step further by
   integrating monitoring and analysis across both the IP and optical
   layers.  This holistic view allows for the detection of complex
   issues that span multiple layers, such as optical signal impairments
   that could degrade IP data transmission quality.  By correlating data
   from both layers, AINetOps solution can provide insights into how
   changes in the optical layer might affect IP performance and vice
   versa.  This enables operators to take preemptive actions, such as
   optimizing signal paths or adjusting routing protocols, to maintain
   optimal network performance.

   The benefits of proactive network assurance and monitoring are
   substantial.  By identifying and addressing potential issues before
   they escalate, network operators can significantly reduce downtime
   and improve service reliability.  This proactive stance not only
   enhances the user experience by ensuring consistent network
   performance but also reduces operational costs associated with
   emergency troubleshooting and repairs.  Furthermore, the use of
   advanced analytics and machine learning in AIOps allows for
   continuous learning and improvement, enabling networks to become more
   resilient and adaptive over time.

   In today's dynamic and high-demand network environments, proactive
   network assurance and monitoring is one of the operational benefits
   provided by AINetOps and are essential for staying ahead of potential
   issues and maintaining a competitive edge.  By leveraging the power
   of AINetOp, network operators can transform their approach from
   reactive to proactive, ensuring that their networks are not only
   robust and resilient but also capable of delivering the high-quality
   service that users expect.  This shift towards proactive assurance
   represents a significant advancement in network management, paving
   the way for more intelligent, efficient, and reliable network
   operations.

5.3.2.  Anomaly Detection

   A critical component of AINetOps in the context of predictive
   analytics is "Anomaly Detection", which leverages advanced ML
   algorithms to enhance network reliability and performance.  By
   employing ML techniques such as supervised, unsupervised or
   reinforcement learning, AINetOps can predict anomalies in real-time
   by analyzing vast amounts of network telemetry data.  Supervised
   learning models, trained on historical data, recognize known issues,
   while unsupervised models identify new anomalies by spotting
   outliers.  This comprehensive detection mechanism ensures both
   familiar and novel network issues are identified promptly.
   Predictive models, utilizing techniques like time-series forecasting,
   enable the identification of potential network problems, such as link
   failures or traffic congestion, before they occur.  By forecasting
   future network states based on historical and current data, these
   models provide early warnings, allowing for timely interventions to
   prevent unexpected downtime and maintain optimal performance.

   Clustering techniques further enhance anomaly detection by grouping
   similar data points to identify patterns and trends that signal
   imminent failures or suboptimal behavior.  This method allows ML
   models to discern subtle changes in network behavior that might
   otherwise go unnoticed.  For example, clustering can reveal traffic
   congestion patterns under specific conditions, enabling preemptive
   measures to alleviate potential issues.  Additionally, clustering
   helps identify the root causes of anomalies by correlating various
   network events and metrics, facilitating a more effective
   troubleshooting process.  By integrating these advanced ML
   techniques, AINetOps not only improves anomaly detection but also
   empowers network operators with the insights needed to maintain a
   high-performing and reliable network infrastructure.

5.3.3.  Trending and Forecasting

   "Trending and Forecasting" operational benefit is distinct but is
   related to "Anomaly Detection" Section 5.3.2.  Trending and
   forecasting in the context of single-layer or multi-layer IP optical
   networks are pivotal components of predictive analytics, providing
   significant operational benefits through AINetOps.  In single-layer
   networks, such as purely IP or optical networks, trending involves
   analyzing historical data to identify patterns and behaviors over
   time.  For instance, in an IP network, trends in traffic volume,
   latency, and packet loss can be monitored to predict future network
   performance and capacity needs.  Similarly, in an optical network,
   trends in signal quality, attenuation, and equipment performance can
   be tracked.  By leveraging these trends, predictive models can
   forecast potential issues such as bandwidth bottlenecks or equipment



Rokui, et al.            Expires 10 August 2025                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft             AINetOps Use Cases              February 2025


   degradation, allowing network operators to proactively optimize
   resources, plan for upgrades, and prevent service disruptions.

   In multi-layer IP optical networks, where both IP and optical layers
   interact, trending and forecasting become even more powerful.  This
   approach involves correlating data from both layers to gain a
   comprehensive understanding of network behavior.  For example, trends
   in optical signal impairments can be analyzed alongside IP traffic
   patterns to predict how physical layer issues might impact data
   transmission and overall network performance.  Forecasting in this
   multi-layer context can identify potential cross-layer issues, such
   as how an increase in optical signal noise might lead to higher IP
   packet error rates.  By anticipating these issues, network operators
   can implement preemptive measures, such as rerouting traffic or
   adjusting signal parameters, to maintain seamless service.  The
   integration of trending and forecasting through AIOps thus enhances
   the resilience and efficiency of IP optical networks, ensuring
   superior performance and reliability.

5.3.4.  Predictive Maintenance

   Predictive maintenance in the context of single-layer or multi-layer
   IP optical networks is other aspect of predictive analytics, offering
   substantial operational benefits through AINeetOps.  In single-layer
   networks, such as purely IP or optical networks, predictive
   maintenance involves using historical and real-time data to forecast
   when network components might fail or degrade.  For instance, in an
   IP network, data from routers and switches, such as CPU usage,
   temperature, and error rates, can be analyzed to predict hardware
   failures.  Similarly, in an optical network, monitoring parameters
   like signal strength, attenuation, and equipment performance helps
   predict when optical amplifiers or transceivers might need
   maintenance.  By accurately forecasting these maintenance needs,
   network operators can schedule interventions before failures occur,
   reducing unplanned downtime and extending the lifespan of network
   components.

   In multi-layer IP optical networks, predictive maintenance becomes
   even more effective by considering the interactions between the IP
   and optical layers.  This approach involves analyzing data from both
   layers to predict maintenance needs that could impact the entire
   network.  For example, if optical layer data indicates a gradual
   degradation in fiber quality, predictive models can assess how this
   might affect IP layer performance, such as increased packet loss or
   latency.  By understanding these cross-layer dependencies, network
   operators can prioritize maintenance activities that have the most
   significant impact on overall network health.  This proactive
   approach ensures that both layers of the network are maintained



Rokui, et al.            Expires 10 August 2025                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft             AINetOps Use Cases              February 2025


   optimally, preventing cascading failures and maintaining high service
   quality.  Through the integration of predictive maintenance with
   AIOps, IP optical networks can achieve greater reliability,
   efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, ensuring uninterrupted service
   delivery to end-users.

5.3.5.  Network Capacity Planning

   Predictive analytics also plays a crucial role in capacity planning
   and performance management.  By forecasting future traffic demands,
   network operators can ensure that the infrastructure is adequately
   scaled to meet those demands without over-provisioning.  This not
   only optimizes the use of resources but also ensures that the network
   can handle peak loads efficiently.  Additionally, predictive
   analytics can help in identifying and mitigating potential security
   threats by analyzing traffic patterns and detecting anomalies that
   may indicate malicious activities.

5.3.6.  Traffic Optimization

   Referring to Section 5.8 for details of AINetOps "Traffic
   Optimization".

   If "Traffic Optimization" is based on prediction of the traffic
   flows, it can be categorized as one of the areas of "Predictive
   Analytics".

5.4.  Network Operational Insights

   "Network Operational Insights" refers to the comprehensive visibility
   and understanding of an IP optical network's performance and
   behavior.  This concept involves collecting and analyzing detailed
   data about the network's operations.  By providing this valuable
   insight to network operators, they can gain a holistic view of the
   network's health and performance.  This enables operators to
   understand their network better and ensure a robust and resilient
   infrastructure.














Rokui, et al.            Expires 10 August 2025                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft             AINetOps Use Cases              February 2025


   By having a detailed understanding of network usage patterns, traffic
   flows, and performance metrics, operators can make data-driven
   decisions to optimize resource allocation and improve overall
   efficiency.  This insight is particularly valuable in multi-layer IP/
   Optical networks, where the interplay between different network
   layers can be complex.  By leveraging these insights, operators can
   ensure that both the IP and optical layers are operating
   harmoniously, leading to optimal performance and cost efficiency.  In
   essence, Network Operational Insights empower operators with the
   knowledge needed to maintain a high-performing, resilient, and
   future-proof network infrastructure.

   The network operational insight can be grouped into two categories.
   By categorizing network operational insights into these two
   categories, operators can better prioritize their efforts and
   resources, ensuring both immediate and long-term network health and
   performance.

5.4.1.  Operational Insights Requiring No Further Analysis

   Network Operational Insights that fall under this category are those
   that can be obtained directly from existing data and real-time
   monitoring without the need for further analysis or simulation.
   These insights provide immediate, actionable information that can
   help network operators quickly identify and address issues.

   These insights are typically derived from real-time monitoring
   systems that continuously track network performance and health
   metrics.  For example, showing the Network Element (NE) with the
   highest alarms or displaying the current alarm table for a specific
   NE (e.g., NE 1.1.1.1) can provide immediate visibility into potential
   issues.  Similarly, identifying the NEs with the highest problems
   during the last hour or plotting the Bit Error Rate (BER) for the 10
   worst modems in a specific region (e.g., Northeast) allows operators
   to quickly pinpoint areas that require attention.  These insights are
   crucial for maintaining network stability and ensuring prompt
   resolution of emerging issues.














Rokui, et al.            Expires 10 August 2025                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft             AINetOps Use Cases              February 2025


   These insights also include detailed information about network
   components and their performance.  For instance, identifying which
   photonic services cross a specific fiber (e.g., OTS1) or determining
   which modems are in use for a particular optical service (e.g., SVC-
   1) can help operators understand the current network configuration
   and its operational status.  Additionally, insights such as the
   average time to failure for similar equipment in the network or
   identifying geographic regions with higher rates of network issues
   provide valuable context for proactive maintenance and resource
   planning.  By leveraging these direct insights, operators can
   maintain a well-functioning network with minimal downtime and optimal
   performance.

5.4.2.  Operational Insights Requiring Further Analysis

   Network Operational Insights in this category require deeper analysis
   and possibly simulation to derive meaningful conclusions.  These
   insights often involve complex scenarios where simple monitoring data
   is insufficient, and further investigation is needed to understand
   the underlying causes or to predict future behavior.

   Insights that require investigation and simulation often involve
   predictive analytics and scenario planning.  For example, determining
   whether an L0 optical service can be created between two cities
   (e.g., city A and Y) involves analyzing the current network topology,
   available resources, and potential constraints.  Similarly,
   understanding why an IP TE-tunnel cannot be established between two
   points (e.g., point A and B) may require simulation of different
   routing scenarios and examination of network policies.  These
   investigations help operators to not only troubleshoot current issues
   but also to plan and optimize future network expansions and
   configurations.

   These insights are crucial for long-term network health and
   performance optimization.  Identifying the most common failure points
   in the network or detecting signs of degradation in wireless network
   performance requires a combination of historical data analysis and
   predictive modeling.  By simulating different maintenance activities
   based on current network health, operators can prioritize tasks that
   will have the most significant impact.  For instance, understanding
   what maintenance activities are needed based on the current network
   health can help in scheduling proactive maintenance that prevents
   future outages.  These insights enable operators to take a strategic
   approach to network management, ensuring sustained performance and
   reliability over time.

Internet-Draft             AINetOps Use Cases              February 2025


5.5.  Network Configuration Management

   AI can assist in automating the generation and enforcement of network
   configurations, significantly enhancing network reliability and
   performance.  By leveraging AI/Gen-AI algorithms, network operators
   can automate the creation of configuration templates that are
   precisely tailored to specific network requirements.  These templates
   can encompass a wide range of settings, such as Quality of Service
   (QoS) parameters, Access Control Lists (ACLs), tunnel configurations,
   and service configuration ensuring that each network segment is
   optimized for its intended purpose.  This automation not only speeds
   up the deployment process but also reduces the likelihood of human
   errors that can occur during manual configuration, leading to a more
   robust and efficient network infrastructure.

   Furthermore, AINetOps can play a role on validation of network
   configuration, i.e., "network configuration audit".  AINetOps plays a
   crucial role in validating configurations against predefined network
   configuration, ensuring that all network setups comply with intent
   configuration.  By continuously monitoring network configurations,
   AINetOps can detect and flag any deviations or misconfigurations that
   could pose security risks or operational inefficiencies.  For
   example, an AI system can identify inconsistencies in ACLs that might
   allow unauthorized access or detect suboptimal QoS settings that
   could degrade service quality.  By proactively addressing these
   issues, AINetOps helps maintain the integrity and performance of the
   network, enabling operators to focus on strategic initiatives rather
   than troubleshooting configuration errors.  This proactive approach
   to configuration management not only enhances network security and
   efficiency but also supports the dynamic and scalable nature of
   modern network environments.

5.6.  IP/Optical Multi-layer Planning

   Multi-layer planning is an approach that integrates the planning of
   IP and optical networks based on traffic patterns, network
   simulations, and capacity planning.  By analyzing these factors, IP
   optical network can be designed to optimize resource allocation,
   enhance network efficiency, and ensure the network can handle current
   and future demands, resulting in a more resilient and scalable
   infrastructure.










Rokui, et al.            Expires 10 August 2025                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft             AINetOps Use Cases              February 2025


5.7.  Cross-Layer and Multi-Layer Optimization

   AI can address the dependencies between different network layers,
   such as IP and optical layers, by integrating data and decision-
   making across these layers.  Multi-layer optimization algorithms
   ensure resource efficiency and performance by aligning the goals of
   individual layers, such as minimizing power consumption at the
   physical layer while maintaining SLA guarantees at the application
   layer.

   Moreover, Network Operational Insights facilitate informed decision-
   making for network optimization and capacity planning.  By having a
   detailed understanding of network usage patterns, traffic flows, and
   performance metrics, operators can make data-driven decisions to
   optimize resource allocation and improve overall efficiency.  This
   insight is particularly valuable in multi-layer IP/Optical networks,
   where the interplay between different network layers can be complex.
   By leveraging these insights, operators can ensure that both the IP
   and optical layers are operating harmoniously, leading to optimal
   performance and cost efficiency.  In essence, Network Operational
   Insights empower operators with the knowledge needed to maintain a
   high-performing, resilient, and future-proof network infrastructure

5.8.  Traffic Optimization

   Another AINetOps operational benefits is "Traffic Optimization" where
   IP/Optical network traffic flows can be monitored and appropriate
   adjustments to network protocols, network topology, network
   configuration, load balancing, bandwidth allocation and so on can be
   dynamically initiated.  AINetOps traffic optimization considers
   multiple factors such as latency, packet loss, and link utilization,
   enabling networks to adapt to changing conditions in real time.

   Expanding on this, AINetOps traffic optimization leverages advanced
   algorithms to continuously monitor network conditions and predict
   potential congestion points before they impact service quality.  By
   analyzing historical data and real-time metrics, machine learning
   models can forecast traffic patterns and proactively adjust routing
   decisions to ensure optimal performance.  For instance, AINetOps can
   reroute traffic through less congested paths when high utilization is
   detected, balancing the load and enhancing overall network
   efficiency.  This intelligent management reduces latency and packet
   loss while maximizing bandwidth utilization.

   Furthermore, traffic optimization enhances the network's ability to
   respond to sudden changes in demand, such as peak usage times or
   unexpected traffic spikes.  Traditional static configurations may
   struggle with such fluctuations, leading to bottlenecks and degraded



Rokui, et al.            Expires 10 August 2025                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft             AINetOps Use Cases              February 2025


   performance.  With AI, the network can dynamically reconfigure itself
   in real-time, redistributing traffic loads and reallocating bandwidth
   as needed.  This adaptability reduces the need for manual
   interventions and allows network operators to focus on strategic
   initiatives.  In essence, AI-driven traffic optimization enables
   networks to be more resilient, responsive, and capable of delivering
   consistent high-quality service.

   Note that "Traffic Optimization" AINetOps operational benefits is
   closely related to "Predictive Analytics" covered in Section 5.3.

5.9.  Closed-Loop Automation

   Closed-loop automation systems use AI to adjust network
   configurations based on real-time data dynamically.  Reinforcement
   learning (RL) algorithms and policy-based decision frameworks can
   automate traffic engineering, resource allocation, and fault
   remediation tasks.  AI-driven systems ensure optimal network
   performance without human intervention by continually monitoring
   network state and applying corrective actions.

5.10.  Network Maintenance and Cleanup

   AI can automate cleanup operations by identifying and resolving
   transient issues, removing redundant configurations, and optimizing
   resource utilization.  These tasks may involve the identification of
   "stale" network states or unused resources, enabling networks to
   operate more efficiently.

5.11.  Network API Construction

   Another significant operational benefit of implementing AINetOps in
   single-layer or multi-layer IP/Optical networks is the generation of
   various Network Controller APIs.  These APIs are essential for the
   seamless integration of network controllers (whether IP, Optical, or
   multi-layer) with Operational Support Systems (OSS) or other network
   controllers.  A key advantage of this operational benefit is that
   operators do not need to possess in-depth knowledge of the APIs.
   Typically, network operators spend considerable time creating and
   verifying APIs to integrate IP or Optical network elements with the
   broader management layer, including OSS/BSS.  By developing robust
   and versatile APIs, network operators can ensure smooth communication
   and coordination between different network management systems,
   thereby enhancing overall network efficiency and performance

   The APIs developed for network controllers serve as a bridge,
   enabling the OSS to interact with the underlying network
   infrastructure in a more dynamic and automated manner.  This



Rokui, et al.            Expires 10 August 2025                [Page 20]

Internet-Draft             AINetOps Use Cases              February 2025


   integration allows for real-time data exchange, automated
   provisioning, and efficient fault management, which are essential for
   maintaining optimal network performance.  Moreover, these APIs
   facilitate the orchestration of network resources across different
   layers, whether it be IP or Optical, ensuring that the network can
   adapt to varying demands and conditions with minimal manual
   intervention.

   AINetOps leverages the power of Generative AI (Gen-AI) to further
   enhance this integration process.  By translating the operator's
   intent into precise network controller APIs, Gen-AI enables a more
   intuitive and user-friendly approach to network management.  This
   translation capability ensures that even complex operational
   requirements can be seamlessly converted into actionable commands for
   the network controllers.  This not only reduces the operational
   burden on network engineers but also significantly enhances the
   agility and responsiveness of the network to changing conditions and
   user demands.

5.12.  AI-Driven Security Monitoring

   AI is becoming a cornerstone of modern network security, enabling
   proactive, adaptive, and intelligent measures to safeguard network
   operations against a rapidly evolving threats.  By leveraging AI,
   network operators can enhance their ability to detect, prevent, and
   respond to threats in real-time while automating complex security
   processes.  This section details the key areas where AI drives
   security enhancements in network operations.

5.12.1.  Threat Detection and Mitigation

   AI significantly enhances threat detection and mitigation through ML
   and deep learning.  By analyzing vast amounts of network traffic
   data, AI models identify unusual patterns and behaviors indicative of
   malicious activity.  This includes detecting anomalies that signal
   threats like zero-day attacks or insider threats, generating real-
   time alerts, and incorporating external threat intelligence to
   recognize known attack signatures.  Together, these capabilities
   enable faster response times and improved threat recognition.

5.12.2.  Intrusion Detection and Prevention

   AI improves intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion
   prevention systems (IPS) by enhancing accuracy and reducing false
   positives.  It achieves this through behavioral analysis, which
   identifies unauthorized access or suspicious activities, and
   automated responses that isolate compromised devices or block

   capabilities ensure continuous updates to address new threats in
   dynamic environments.

5.12.3.  Security Policy Automation

   Using AI would simplify the creation and enforcement of security
   policies by automating configurations and adjustments, reducing the
   potential for human error.  It dynamically updates firewall rules and
   access controls based on real-time threat intelligence, assigns risk
   scores to network devices and applications to prioritize enforcement,
   and ensures compliance with regulatory standards by monitoring for
   deviations and recommending corrective actions.

6.  AINetOps Scenarios and Use-cases

   This section further expands Section 5 by exploring scenarios and use
   cases for applying AINetOps in network operations, focusing on their
   architectural, procedural, and protocol-level requirements.  Each use
   case highlights how AINetOps can be leveraged to address challenges
   in network management and optimization, while identifying the
   relevant IETF protocols, interfaces, and data models that are
   involved or need enhancement.

   For every use case described, the following dimensions are examined
   to provide a comprehensive understanding of its implications and
   requirements.

6.1.  Network Active and Reactive Assurance

   Network active and reactive assurance, both at the single- layer (IP
   or Optical) and multi-layer (IP over Optical), are critical
   components in maintaining the health and stability of modern IP,
   Optical, and IPoDWDM networks.  This process involves the
   identification and resolution of network issues as they arise,
   ensuring that any disruptions or degradations are promptly addressed.
   By employing AINetOps techniques, network engineers can quickly
   pinpoint the root cause of problems, whether they originate in the IP
   layer, the optical layer, or across both.  This reactive approach is
   essential for minimizing downtime and maintaining the quality of
   service expected by network users.

   In single-layer troubleshooting, the focus is on isolating and
   resolving issues within a specific layer of the network.  Multi-layer
   troubleshooting, on the other hand, requires a more integrated
   approach, as it involves identifying and resolving issues that span
   across multiple layers of the network.  This could include problems
   where an issue in the optical layer affects the IP layer.

   In both reactive and active assurance, network faults have already
   occurred.  These faults may include impairments such as optical fiber
   cuts, IP packet drops, IP link latency issues, or Threshold Crossing
   Alarms (TCA), among others.

   As illustrated in Figure 3, reactive assurance assumes that a fault
   occurs in the IP/Optical network (Step A) and is subsequently
   detected by the operator through various means (Step B).  Detection
   methods may include alarm monitoring, performance telemetry data
   analysis, or customer reports indicating service disruptions.  To
   initiate troubleshooting, the operator can launch the AIOps-
   Assistant, which acts as the front-end interface for AINetOps (Step
   C).  The assistant then utilizes the backend assurance and
   troubleshooting mechanisms, leveraging a Gen-AI multi-agent
   framework.  In Step D, a dynamic workflow is executed to diagnose the
   issue and identify potential root causes.  Optionally, at Step E, the
   Gen-AI dynamic workflow can recommend remedial actions to resolve the
   issue and implement these actions in a closed-loop fashion, ensuring
   automated network recovery.

   Alarms (TCA), among others.

   The active assurance and troubleshooting process is illustrated in
   Figure 4.  In contrast to Figure 3, active assurance assumes that a
   fault occurs in the IP/Optical network (Step A) and is subsequently
   detected automatically by higher-layer controllers (Step B).  These
   controllers may employ detection methods that include monitoring
   alarms, analyzing performance telemetry data, or processing customer
   reports indicating service disruptions.  To initiate troubleshooting,
   the detection logic launches the AIOps-Assistant, which serves as the
   front-end interface for AINetOps (Step C).  Steps D and E are
   identical to those depicted in Figure 3.

6.2.  Network Pro-active Assurance

   Unlike reactive and active assurance, proactive assurance does not
   wait for a fault to occur in the IP/Optical network.  Instead, the
   network is continuously monitored through a series of trending and
   forecasting processes designed to detect early signs of deterioration
   that may eventually lead to faults.

   As illustrated in Figure 5, achieving proactive assurance involves
   running multiple processes that continuously monitor network
   performance.  These processes collect and analyze a wide array of
   network telemetry data—including performance monitoring (PM) data,
   alarms, logs, network topology, and inventory details (Step A).  By
   employing various techniques including advanced AI/ML algorithms,
   these processes provide real-time trending and forecasting insights,
   identifying patterns and anomalies that could indicate potential
   degradation (Step B).

   When these background processes detect any signs of deterioration or
   anomalous behavior, they trigger the AIOps-Assistant for further
   investigation (Step C).  The AIOps-Assistant then leverages a Gen-AI
   multi-agent framework to initiate the assurance and troubleshooting
   procedures.  In Step D, a dynamic workflow is executed to thoroughly
   diagnose the emerging issue and identify potential root causes.
   Optionally, at Step E, the Gen-AI dynamic workflow can recommend
   remedial actions to resolve the identified issues.  These
   recommendations can be implemented in a closed-loop fashion, ensuring
   automated network recovery and continuous improvement of network
   performance.  This proactive approach not only mitigates the risk of
   unexpected network faults but also optimizes operational efficiency
   by addressing issues before they escalate into service-impacting
   events.

   Furthermore, by integrating advanced analytics with automated
   corrective measures, proactive assurance enhances overall network
   resilience.  It enables network operators to maintain a high quality
   of service and reliability, even in complex and dynamic network
   environments.

6.17.  AI-Driven Resilience Testing

   This use case leverages AI to design and execute fault injection
   scenarios that test the resilience of IP/optical networks under
   simulated failure conditions. By proactively introducing controlled
   disruptions—such as packet drops, latency spikes, or optical signal
   degradation—AI assesses the network's ability to detect, respond, and
   recover from faults. This approach enhances network robustness by
   identifying weaknesses and validating automated recovery mechanisms
   before real failures occur, addressing both single-layer (IP or
   optical) and multi-layer (IP over optical) scenarios.

   The AI system analyzes historical failure data (e.g., fiber cuts,
   equipment outages), real-time telemetry (e.g., latency, BER), and
   external factors (e.g., weather events, traffic surges) to model
   probable failure points. It then injects faults, monitors the
   network’s response, and refines recovery strategies, potentially in a
   closed-loop manner. For example, an AI model might predict a high-risk
   optical link based on trending attenuation, simulate a fiber cut, and
   evaluate whether IP-layer rerouting maintains SLAs. If recovery is
   suboptimal, it suggests adjustments (e.g., updating TE policies) and
   retests.

6.17.1.  Architecture

   The architecture integrates an AI Fault Injection Engine with network
   controllers and elements to simulate faults and assess resilience
   across IP and optical layers. Figure 12 illustrates this design,
   showing the AI Fault Injection Engine interfacing with packet (P-PNC)
   and optical (O-PNC) Physical Network Controllers, which manage the
   IP/optical network. The engine designs fault scenarios, injects them
   via controller APIs, collects telemetry feedback, and triggers
   recovery actions as needed. This centralized approach leverages
   existing IETF control-plane components, ensuring compatibility with
   multi-layer coordination frameworks like ACTN.

     Figure 12: Architecture for AI-Driven Resilience Testing

6.17.2.  Interfaces and APIs

   The AI Fault Injection Engine interfaces with network controllers
   using standard management and telemetry APIs. NETCONF (RFC 6241) or
   RESTCONF (RFC 8040) enables fault injection by sending commands to
   disable interfaces, drop packets, or adjust optical parameters (e.g.,
   signal power). Real-time telemetry is collected via gNMI (gRPC Network
   Management Interface) or OpenConfig streams, providing metrics like
   latency, packet loss, and Bit Error Rate (BER). External data sources
   (e.g., weather APIs, threat intelligence feeds) may integrate via REST
   APIs to enrich fault scenario design.

6.17.3.  Protocols

   Several IETF protocols support this use case. PCEP (RFC 5440)
   extensions could enable dynamic path recomputation during fault
   scenarios, testing traffic engineering resilience. BGP (RFC 4271) or
   OSPF (RFC 2328) adjustments validate routing protocol stability under
   simulated failures. For optical layers, OTN (G.709) or ASON (G.8080)
   signaling protocols facilitate fault injection (e.g., simulating fiber
   cuts). Telemetry protocols like IPFIX (RFC 7011) or SNMP (RFC 3411)
   provide feedback data, though streaming alternatives (e.g., gNMI) are
   preferred for real-time needs.

6.17.4.  Data Models

   YANG models are central to representing fault injection and resilience
   data. The base Network Topology Model (RFC 8345) can be extended with
   new YANG modules to define fault parameters (e.g., failure type,
   duration, scope) and resilience metrics (e.g., recovery time, SLA
   compliance). OpenConfig YANG models for interfaces (e.g.,
   openconfig-interfaces) and optical transport (e.g.,
   openconfig-terminal-device) support fault execution and telemetry
   collection. A new YANG model may be needed to standardize fault
   injection workflows and outcomes.

6.17.5.  Processes and Procedures

   The process begins with AI training on historical failure data,
   synthetic scenarios, and real-time network state, using ML techniques
   like supervised learning for fault prediction and reinforcement
   learning for recovery optimization. Fault injection tests are
   scheduled (e.g., off-peak) or triggered on-demand, with operator
   oversight via an AIOps-Assistant interface (similar to 6.8). Post-test
   analysis generates reports on resilience gaps, updates network
   policies (e.g., QoS, routing), and refines the AI model’s training
   dataset. Closed-loop automation may execute recovery actions
   autonomously, validated by subsequent tests.

6.17.6.  Alignment with IETF

   This use case aligns with ongoing IETF efforts in multiple working
   groups. The Network Management Research Group (NMRG) explores AI
   applications in networking, providing a foundation for fault injection
   methodologies. The Traffic Engineering Architecture and Signaling
   (TEAS) working group’s work on resilience and path computation (e.g.,
   RFC 8453 for ACTN) supports multi-layer testing. Extensions to YANG
   (NETMOD), PCEP (PCE), and telemetry protocols (OPSAWG) could
   standardize fault injection and resilience assessment, fostering
   interoperability across vendor implementations.






6.18.  Energy Efficiency Optimization

   This use case employs AI to optimize energy consumption across IP/optical
   networks by dynamically adjusting network resources based on traffic
   demand, equipment performance, and environmental conditions. With
   routers, switches, and optical amplifiers contributing significantly to
   power usage, AI-driven energy management reduces operational costs and
   carbon footprints while maintaining performance and reliability. It
   addresses both single-layer (IP or optical) and multi-layer (IP over
   optical) scenarios.

   The AI system analyzes real-time telemetry (e.g., power usage, link
   utilization), historical patterns (e.g., peak/off-peak traffic), and
   external factors (e.g., electricity costs, cooling needs) to identify
   energy-saving opportunities. Actions include powering down idle ports,
   rerouting traffic to consolidate active paths, tuning optical signal
   parameters, or scheduling high-energy tasks during low-cost periods. For
   instance, during off-peak hours, the AI might deactivate redundant IP
   interfaces or reduce optical amplifier gain, ensuring SLAs are met with
   minimal power draw.

6.18.1.  Architecture

   The architecture for energy efficiency optimization mirrors the
   centralized design used for AI-Driven Resilience Testing (see Section
   6.17). Figure 12 illustrates this, with the AI Energy Optimization
   Engine replacing the AI Fault Injection Engine, interfacing with
   Physical Packet Network Controllers (P-PNC) and Optical Physical Network
   Controllers (O-PNC) to manage the IP/optical network. The engine
   collects telemetry and external data, computes energy-efficient
   configurations, and applies them via controller APIs. In this context,
   (A) represents energy optimization commands (e.g., power down ports,
   adjust signal gain), (B) denotes telemetry feedback (e.g., power usage,
   traffic load), and (C) indicates configuration updates (e.g., reroute
   traffic, schedule operations).



6.18.2.  Interfaces and APIs

   The interfaces and APIs are largely identical to those in Section 6.17,
   adapted for energy optimization. NETCONF (RFC 6241) or RESTCONF (RFC
   8040) delivers commands to adjust power states or reroute traffic, while
   gNMI or OpenConfig streams provide real-time telemetry (e.g., power
   consumption, utilization). External inputs, such as electricity pricing
   or weather data, integrate via REST APIs to inform optimization,
   consistent with the approach in 6.17.

6.18.3.  Protocols

   The protocols align closely with those in Section 6.17, tailored for
   energy goals. PCEP (RFC 5440) supports traffic rerouting to consolidate
   paths, reducing energy use. BGP (RFC 4271) or OSPF (RFC 2328) adjustments
   optimize routing efficiency. For optical layers, OTN (G.709) signaling
   tunes power settings (e.g., lowering laser output). Telemetry protocols
   like IPFIX (RFC 7011) or SNMP (RFC 3411) provide feedback, with streaming
   alternatives (e.g., gNMI) preferred for real-time needs, as noted in
   6.18.

6.18.4.  Data Models

   YANG models for energy optimization build on those in Section 6.17. The
   Network Topology Model (RFC 8345) can be augmented to define
   energy-specific parameters (e.g., power states, utilization thresholds)
   and metrics (e.g., watts consumed, energy cost), extending the
   fault-related models from 6.18. OpenConfig models for interfaces and
   optical transport support power adjustments and telemetry, with a
   potential new YANG model to standardize energy efficiency policies.

6.18.5.  Processes and Procedures

   The process begins with AI training on historical energy usage, traffic
   patterns, and cost data, using reinforcement learning for policy
   optimization and time-series analysis for demand forecasting.
   Optimization runs continuously or on a schedule, with operator oversight
   via an AIOps-Assistant (similar to 6.8). Post-optimization, the AI
   evaluates energy savings against performance impacts, updating policies
   and retraining as needed. Closed-loop automation applies adjustments,
   validated by telemetry, following the workflow principles in 6.17.

6.18.6.  Alignment with IETF

   This use case aligns with IETF efforts in sustainability and network
   management, paralleling 6.17’s standardization ties. The Operations and
   Management Area Working Group (OPSAWG) supports telemetry and efficiency
   metrics, while the Traffic Engineering Architecture and Signaling (TEAS)
   working group’s path optimization work (e.g., RFC 8453 for ACTN) enables
   energy-efficient rerouting. Extensions to YANG (NETMOD), PCEP (PCE), and
   telemetry standards (OPSAWG) could standardize energy optimization,
   leveraging the same frameworks proposed in 6.17.





6.19.  AI-Driven Green Energy Optimization

   This use case leverages AI to optimize network and compute operations by
   prioritizing resources powered by green energy sources (e.g., solar,
   wind) over conventional ones, while ensuring performance requirements
   (e.g., latency, throughput) are met. As networks increasingly rely on
   distributed compute elements like Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) or
   edge servers, selecting energy sources for these workloads impacts both
   sustainability and cost. This applies to single-layer (e.g., IP compute
   nodes) and multi-layer (e.g., IP over optical with compute) scenarios.

   The AI system analyzes real-time telemetry (e.g., latency, traffic load),
   energy source data (e.g., green vs. conventional availability), and
   external factors (e.g., renewable energy forecasts) to decide where and
   how to execute compute tasks. For example, in a mobile core network, a
   media optimizer VNF processing mobility traffic could be instantiated on
   a green-energy-powered server in a specific NFVi Point of Delivery (PoD)
   or datacenter instead of a conventionally powered one, provided latency
   SLAs are not violated. If green resources are unavailable or
   insufficient, the AI shifts workloads or adjusts traffic paths
   dynamically, balancing sustainability with service quality.

6.19.1.  Architecture

   The architecture integrates an AI Green Energy Optimization Engine with
   both compute orchestration and network control layers to manage workload
   placement and traffic across IP/optical networks and NFVi PoDs or
   datacenters. Figure 14 illustrates this design, showing the AI engine
   interfacing with an NFV Orchestrator (NFVO) to shift compute jobs (e.g.,
   VNFs) between PoDs/datacenters based on green energy availability, and
   optionally with Physical Packet Network Controllers (P-PNC) and Optical
   Physical Network Controllers (O-PNC) for traffic adjustments. The engine
   collects telemetry and energy data, computes optimal configurations, and
   applies them via orchestration and controller APIs.

6.19.2.  Interfaces and APIs

   Interfaces extend those in Sections 6.17 and 6.18, with a focus on
   compute orchestration. The NFVO uses ETSI NFV MANO APIs (e.g., Os-Ma-nfvo
   reference point) to instantiate or migrate VNFs across NFVi PoDs/
   datacenters based on green energy availability. NETCONF (RFC 6241) or
   RESTCONF (RFC 8040) manages traffic adjustments via P-PNC/O-PNC when
   needed, while gNMI or OpenConfig streams provide telemetry (e.g.,
   latency, server energy type). REST APIs integrate external data like
   green energy availability or weather forecasts, consistent with 6.17.

6.19.3.  Protocols

   Protocols align with Sections 6.17 and 6.18, with additions for compute
   management. PCEP (RFC 5440) enables traffic rerouting to align with
   green-energy-powered nodes, while BGP (RFC 4271) or OSPF (RFC 2328)
   adjusts routing paths. OTN (G.709) signaling supports optical
   adjustments if involved. For compute, ETSI NFV protocols (e.g.,
   VE-Vnfm-vnf for VNF management) complement network protocols. Telemetry
   uses IPFIX (RFC 7011) or SNMP (RFC 3411), with streaming options (e.g.,
   gNMI) preferred, as in 6.17.

6.19.4.  Data Models

   YANG models build on Sections 6.17 and 6.18, with compute-specific
   extensions. The Network Topology Model (RFC 8345) can be augmented to
   include NFVi PoD/datacenter attributes (e.g., energy source, compute
   capacity) and metrics (e.g., carbon footprint, latency). OpenConfig
   models for interfaces and ETSI NFV YANG models (e.g., for VNF
   descriptors) support configuration and telemetry. A new YANG model may
   standardize green energy optimization across network and compute domains.

6.19.5.  Processes and Procedures

   The process starts with AI training on historical traffic, latency, and
   energy source data, using reinforcement learning to optimize green
   energy use and predictive models for renewable availability.
   Optimization runs continuously, shifting VNFs to green PoDs/datacenters
   or adjusting traffic when viable, with operator oversight via an AIOps-
   Assistant (similar to 6.8). Post-optimization, the AI assesses
   sustainability gains against performance, updating policies and
   retraining. Closed-loop automation adjusts configurations, validated by
   telemetry, following 6.18’s workflow.

6.19.6.  Alignment with IETF

   This use case aligns with IETF’s sustainability and compute-network
   integration efforts. The Operations and Management Area Working Group
   (OPSAWG) supports telemetry for energy metrics, while the Computing in
   the Network Research Group (COINRG) and Network Function Virtualization
   Research Group (NFVRG) address compute placement, applicable to VNFs.
   The Traffic Engineering Architecture and Signaling (TEAS) working
   group’s efforts (e.g., RFC 8453 for ACTN) enable green-energy-aware
   routing. Extensions to YANG (NETMOD), PCEP (PCE), and telemetry
   standards (OPSAWG) could standardize this, leveraging 6.17 and 6.18
   frameworks.





6.20.  AI-Driven Policy Enforcement and Compliance Auditing

   This use case leverages AI to automate the enforcement of network
   policies and auditing of compliance with regulatory standards and
   internal guidelines. By continuously monitoring network configurations,
   traffic, and security postures, AI ensures that policies are
   consistently applied and compliance requirements are met. This use case
   addresses both single-layer (e.g., IP) and multi-layer (e.g., IP over
   optical) scenarios, as well as cross-domain environments.

   The AI system analyzes real-time telemetry (e.g., configuration
   changes, traffic flows, security logs), historical data, and external
   inputs (e.g., regulatory updates, threat intelligence) to enforce
   policies and audit compliance. For example, AI can detect unauthorized
   changes to firewall rules, enforce encryption standards for sensitive
   data, or ensure that network configurations align with GDPR
   requirements. If violations are detected, AI can automatically
   remediate issues or alert operators for manual intervention.

6.20.1.  Architecture

   The architecture integrates an AI Policy Enforcement and Compliance
   Engine with network controllers, security systems, and orchestration
   platforms. Figure 15 illustrates this design, showing the AI engine
   interfacing with Physical Packet Network Controllers (P-PNC), Optical
   Physical Network Controllers (O-PNC), and Security Information and
   Event Management (SIEM) systems. The engine collects telemetry,
   enforces policies, and audits compliance, applying corrective actions
   via controller APIs.

     Figure 15: Architecture for AI-Driven Policy Enforcement and Compliance Auditing

6.20.2.  Interfaces and APIs

   The AI engine interfaces with network controllers and security systems
   using standard management and telemetry APIs. NETCONF (RFC 6241) or
   RESTCONF (RFC 8040) delivers policy enforcement commands, while gNMI or
   OpenConfig streams provide real-time telemetry (e.g., configuration
   changes, traffic flows). SIEM systems integrate via REST APIs to
   provide security logs and threat intelligence.

6.20.3.  Protocols

   The protocols align with existing IETF standards. PCEP (RFC 5440)
   supports traffic engineering adjustments to enforce QoS policies, while
   BGP (RFC 4271) or OSPF (RFC 2328) ensures routing compliance. For
   security, protocols like IPsec (RFC 4301) and TLS (RFC 8446) enforce
   encryption standards. Telemetry protocols like IPFIX (RFC 7011) or SNMP
   (RFC 3411) provide feedback, with streaming alternatives (e.g., gNMI)
   preferred for real-time needs.

6.20.4.  Data Models

   YANG models are central to representing policies and compliance data.
   The Network Topology Model (RFC 8345) can be extended to define policy
   parameters (e.g., access control, encryption) and compliance metrics
   (e.g., audit logs, violation counts). OpenConfig YANG models for
   interfaces and security support configuration and telemetry. A new YANG
   model may standardize policy enforcement and compliance workflows.

6.20.5.  Processes and Procedures

   The process begins with AI training on historical configuration data,
   security logs, and regulatory requirements. Policy enforcement runs
   continuously, with operator oversight via an AIOps-Assistant (similar
   to 6.8). Post-audit, the AI generates compliance reports, updates
   policies, and retrains as needed. Closed-loop automation applies
   corrective actions, validated by telemetry.

6.20.6.  Alignment with IETF

   This use case aligns with IETF efforts in network management, security,
   and policy enforcement. The Operations and Management Area Working
   Group (OPSAWG) supports telemetry for compliance metrics, while the
   Security Area Working Group (SEC) addresses policy enforcement.
   Extensions to YANG (NETMOD), PCEP (PCE), and telemetry standards
   (OPSAWG) could standardize this use case, leveraging frameworks
   proposed in 6.17 and 6.18.
